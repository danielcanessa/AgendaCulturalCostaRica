# AgendaCulturalCostaRica

Agenda Cultural Costa Rica is a web application designed to promote and organize cultural events throughout Costa Rica. It allows event organizers to publish events, visitors to discover and bookmark them, and registered users to participate through comments and ratings.

This project is developed as part of the **Software Design course** at CENFOTEC, to apply best practices in full-stack web development, system architecture, and usability/accessibility design.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Django + Django REST Framework
- **Database**: MySQL

## Features
- Public event listings with filters
- Accessibility metadata per event
- User authentication and role-based permissions
- Personalized "My Agenda" section
- Event comments and rating system
- Admin interface for managing users and content

## Development Setup (Automatic)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AgendaCulturalCostaRica.git
cd AgendaCulturalCostaRica
````

### 2. Run the setup script

This command will:

* Recreate the MySQL database
* Set up a Python virtual environment
* Install backend dependencies
* Apply Django migrations
* Load sample data
* Start the Django development server

> Replace `mysqlpassword` with your actual MySQL root password.

```bash
./setup.sh mysqlpassword
```

Once complete, the API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Backend Configuration (Important)

Make sure the following settings are configured correctly in `backend/agendacultural/settings.py`.

### Database settings

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'agenda_cultural',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'mysqlpassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

### Required `INSTALLED_APPS`

Ensure these apps are listed:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # Third-party
    'rest_framework',
    'django_extensions',

    # Project apps
    'events',
]
```

> `django_extensions` is required for running custom scripts with `manage.py runscript`.

## How to Add New Tables (Models)

To add a new table (model) to the Django backend and expose it through the API, follow these steps:

### 1. Define the model

In the corresponding app folder (e.g., `backend/events/models.py`), create your model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Venue(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    location = models.TextField()
```

### 2. Create a serializer

In `backend/events/serializers.py`, create a serializer for the model:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Venue

class VenueSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Venue
        fields = '__all__'
```

### 3. Create a ViewSet

In `events/views.py`, create a view for the model:

```python
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Venue
from .serializers import VenueSerializer

class VenueViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Venue.objects.all()
    serializer_class = VenueSerializer
```

### 4. Register the ViewSet in `backend/events/urls.py`

Make sure the app has a `urls.py` file (create one if not) and register the view:

```python
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import VenueViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'venues', VenueViewSet)

urlpatterns = router.urls
```

### 5. Include app URLs in the main `urls.py`

In `backend/agendacultural/urls.py`, include the app's routes:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('events.urls')),  # Add this line
]
```

### 6. Create migrations and apply them

Run the following commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. (Optional) Register model in the admin interface

In `events/admin.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Venue

admin.site.register(Venue)
```

### 8. (Optional) Seed initial data

If you want to pre-populate your table, update `backend/scripts/load_sample_data.py`:

```python
from events.models import Venue

Venue.objects.get_or_create(name="National Theater", location="San Jos√©")
```

Then run:

```bash
python manage.py runscript load_sample_data
```

### 9. Test the endpoint

Visit:
`http://localhost:8000/api/venues/`

You should see the list of records (empty if no data yet).

## Frontend Setup (Manual)

From the `frontend/` folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and interact with the backend API.

## Notes

* Make sure you have MySQL installed and running.
* Python version: 3.10 or later is recommended.
* Node.js v18+ is recommended for the frontend.
